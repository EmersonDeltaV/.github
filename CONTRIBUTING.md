# Introduction

Contributors play a crucial role in maintaining the project. The contributor role, as of this moment, is currently limited to Emerson employees. Weâ€™ll let you know once it is open to developers outside Emerson. Nevertheless, we would like to provide additional information about what you can expect once you gain the ability to contribute in the future.

Here are the responsibilities and processes regarding the Emerson DeltaV GitHub org account.

# Responsibilities

## Contributors

Here are their responsibilities:

   * **Code of Conduct:** Contributors will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://dev.azure.com/EmersonPSS/PSS/_git/Amber_Github?path=/code-of-conduct.md&_a=preview) in managing code. We will update this section with links to our code of conduct page once we allow public contributors.
   * **Avoid Sensitive Information:** Never commit sensitive information. If you accidentally do so, promptly notify the owners via email at [opensource.deltav@emerson.com](mailto:opensource.deltav@emerson.com?subject=Concern).

# Processes

## Requesting a new Repository

Contributors need to follow these steps when requesting a new repository:

1. **Answer our Emerson internal document [licensing-questionnaire](https://dev.azure.com/EmersonPSS/PSS/_git/Amber_Github?path=/licensing-questionnaire.md&_a=preview).** This ensures that the owners and legal team understand which license is appropriate for the new repo.
2. **Send an email** to [opensource.deltav@emerson.com](mailto:opensource.deltav@emerson.com) with the subject **[DeltaV GitHub] Request New Repo** and include the following information:
   * Proposed Name
   * Product
   * Description
   * GitIgnore to be used (refer to this link: [GitHub gitignore options](https://github.com/github/gitignore))
   * Proposed License (also, attach the answered licensing questionnaire)
3. **Update the readme file** to explain the purpose of the repo, what to expect, and how to run the app locally. Consider the following when creating the main readme file for your repository:
   * Descriptive information
   * Purpose of the repo
   * Instructions for running the app locally (including prerequisites and steps)
   * Optionally, include pipeline badges (e.g., build badge, SonarQube badge, NuGet version badge) if applicable.

## Mitigating Committed Sensitive Data

It is the responsibility of all contributors to avoid committing any sensitive data. However, if sensitive data is accidentally committed, contributors must send an email to [opensource.deltav@emerson.com](mailto:opensource.deltav@emerson.com?subject=Concern) as soon as possible.

# Feedback
