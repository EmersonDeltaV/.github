   * **Coverity Check:** Contributors should execute the Coverity check before committing any changes to any repository.

# Processes

## Requesting a new Repository

### Contributor Responsibilities
Contributors need to follow these steps when requesting a new repository:

1. **Answer our Emerson internal document [licensing-questionnaire](https://dev.azure.com/EmersonPSS/PSS/_git/Amber_Github?path=/licensing-questionnaire.md&_a=preview).** This ensures that the owners and legal team understand which license is appropriate for the new repo.
2. **Send an email** to [opensource.deltav@emerson.com](mailto:opensource.deltav@emerson.com) with the subject **[DeltaV GitHub] Request New Repo** and include the following information:
   * Proposed Name
   * Product
   * Description
   * GitIgnore to be used (refer to this link: [GitHub gitignore options](https://github.com/github/gitignore))
   * Proposed License (also, attach the answered licensing questionnaire)
3. **Update the readme file** to explain the purpose of the repo, what to expect, and how to run the app locally. Consider the following when creating the main readme file for your repository:
   * Descriptive information
   * Purpose of the repo
   * Instructions for running the app locally (including prerequisites and steps)
   * Optionally, include pipeline badges (e.g., build badge, SonarQube badge, NuGet version badge) if applicable.
